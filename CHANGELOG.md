# Development Log

This file tracks the key features and changes implemented in the BizStream application.

## Architectural Planning & Design Phase

- **Product Requirements Definition:** Collaboratively defined the core problem, target audience, and feature set for the application. Established foundational requirements including multi-user RBAC, data import/export, transactional integrity, and a guided setup process.
- **Technical Architecture Evaluation:** Analyzed three distinct backend architecture scenarios ("Modular Control", "Integrated BaaS", and "Next.js Full Stack"). Evaluated each against criteria of control, open-source principles, ease of development, and deployment flexibility (both cloud and on-premise).
- **Final Architecture Decision:** Selected the **"Next.js Full Stack"** architecture as the official path forward. This approach, using Next.js for both frontend and backend logic connected to a PostgreSQL database via Prisma, offers the best balance of simplicity, developer experience, and deployment versatility for the project's goals.

## Initial Project Setup & Core Features

- **Project Scaffolding**: Bootstrapped a new Next.js project with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and ShadCN UI.
- **Initial Modules**: Created the basic UI and functionality for Sales, Inventory, and Clients using mock data.
- **UI/UX Refinements**: Added "Cancel" buttons to forms and fixed bugs in the product selector for better usability.

## Full Database Integration & Feature Expansion

- **Database Schema**: Implemented the full database schema with Prisma, connecting all core entities including Products, Sales, Purchases, and Payments.
- **Counterparty Refactor**: Replaced the initial `Client` model with a more flexible `Counterparty` model, allowing entities to be designated as a "Client," "Vendor," or both. All relevant pages and actions were updated to use this new system.
- **Sales Module Integration**: The Sales module is now fully connected to the database. Creating a sales order correctly decrements product stock levels in a single, reliable transaction.
- **Point of Sale (POS) Integration**: The POS interface is now fully functional, fetching real product data and creating official sales orders that update inventory.
- **Purchases Module**: Implemented the complete Purchases module, allowing users to create and manage purchase orders for vendors.
- **Wallet System**: The Payments module has been enhanced with a full Wallet System. Users can now create multiple wallets (e.g., "Bank Account", "Cash Drawer") and every payment transaction is linked to a specific wallet, accurately updating its balance.

## Testing & Quality Assurance

- **Test Suite Setup**: Configured a comprehensive testing environment using Jest and React Testing Library.
- **Core Module Tests**: Wrote and maintained unit and integration tests for all major features, including Counterparties, Inventory, Sales (listing and creation), Purchases (listing and creation), Payments, and the Point of Sale interface. This ensures stability and reliability as the application grows.
