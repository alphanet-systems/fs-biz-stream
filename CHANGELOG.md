# Development Log

This file tracks the key features and changes implemented in the BizStream application.

## Architectural Planning & Design Phase

- **Product Requirements Definition:** Collaboratively defined the core problem, target audience, and feature set for the application. Established foundational requirements including multi-user RBAC, data import/export, transactional integrity, and a guided setup process.
- **Technical Architecture Evaluation:** Analyzed three distinct backend architecture scenarios ("Modular Control", "Integrated BaaS", and "Next.js Full Stack"). Evaluated each against criteria of control, open-source principles, ease of development, and deployment flexibility (both cloud and on-premise).
- **Final Architecture Decision:** Selected the **"Next.js Full Stack"** architecture as the official path forward. This approach, using Next.js for both frontend and backend logic connected to a PostgreSQL database via Prisma, offers the best balance of simplicity, developer experience, and deployment versatility for the project's goals.

## Initial Project Setup

- Bootstrapped a new Next.js project using TypeScript.
- Integrated Tailwind CSS for styling and ShadCN UI for the component library.
- Established the basic application shell, including a sidebar navigation and header.
- Set up mock data to simulate a real-world business environment with clients, products, and sales.

## Core Feature Implementation

- **Sales Module**:
    - Replaced the initial concept of "Invoicing" with a more robust "Sales" module to better represent the sales lifecycle in an ERP.
    - Created pages to list all sales orders and to create new sales orders.
    - Sales orders can have statuses like "Pending," "Fulfilled," and "Cancelled."
    - Added the ability to generate an invoice from a sales order via a dropdown menu action or a checkbox on the creation page.

- **Inventory Integration**:
    - The "Create New Sale" page is now fully integrated with the inventory.
    - When adding items to a sales order, users can search for products from the inventory.
    - The system displays available stock for each product and warns the user if they attempt to sell more than is available.

- **UI/UX Refinements**:
    - Added "Cancel" buttons to all creation forms (`Add Client`, `Add Product`, `New Sale`) for improved usability.
    - Fixed a critical bug in the product selector on the "New Sale" page where items could not be selected with a mouse click.
    - Polished the styling of the product selector to ensure visual consistency for highlighted items.
